# RenewableLava
An attempt to add a way to generate lava in Minecraft. Powered by Fabric.
##Mechanics
This mod allows you to create 1 Bucket of Lava with only 4 Obsidian and 16 Blaze Powder. Simply put the Obsidian and Blaze Powder in a Cauldron and it will slowly convert into Lava. Then you can take it out with and empty Bucket. 

The Cauldron itself will convert into a Crucible after putting an Obsidian into it. Breaking it will drop a Cauldron.

You can also put Lava sources next and under the Cauldron for better results. The upper limit is 5 Lava sources *(when it is above Cauldron it does **not** count)*.

Very simple.
